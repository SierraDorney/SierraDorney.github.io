<h1> "Music, at its essence, is what gives us memories.
 And the longer a song has existed in our lives, the more memories we have of it." - Stevie Wonder  </h1>

<h3>This page is where you can explore a multitude of different music groups, genres and playlists! 
Music is something I have a strong passion for and I have always been surrounded by. Ever since I was young I've been
going to concerts with my family and as I grew up started to explore my own taste of music and ventured out to a different 
array of concerts. I am inspired by so many different artists whom all express themselves so uniquely within their 
music.</h3>
