Hello Everyone!

<h1> ~ I'm Sierra Dorney ~ </h1>

<h3>I'm a Student at The University of Maine, with a Business Management Major. 
I was born in northern Maine and spent my entire life growing up in a small town 
called Kennebunk; where our former president George Bush lives! Throughout this website you'll find a summary 
of my interests, links to my blogs and other resources, as well as an extensive amount of photos!</h3>
<p> I hope whoever comes across my page enjoys it and benefits from what I have to share!</p>
