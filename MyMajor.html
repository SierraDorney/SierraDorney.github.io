<h1> Here you will learn a little more about me and why I chose to devote my time to
	 a degree in Business Management. </h1>

<h3> When I first arrived at college I had no idea what I was going to do with my career. 
	 After finishing one full year of college it was time to decide what I wanted to focus
	 on. At first, I thought Food and Nutrition Science, but that wasn't for me. Then, that's
	 when I started to look in the Business School at The University of Maine. The Umaine Business 
	 program has many different fields that you can explore. Such as, marketing, finance, accounting,
	 management and more! 	 </h3>
	 

	 <p> Some required courses that Umaine offers are:
	 - Organizational Behavior
	 - Business and Society
	 - Human Resource Management 
	 </p>
	 
	
	<p> Where can a degree in Business take you?
		<p>1. Sales Manager </p>
		<p>2. Buyers and Purchasing Agents	</p>
	 	<p>3. Financial Services Sales Agents</p>
	 <p>	4. Human Resources Managers</p>
	 <p>	5. Hospital and Health Services Administrators </p>
	 	(In all of these fields a bachelors degree is required so it's important
	 	 to keep that in mind!) </p>
