<h3> Fitness is something I value with a passion and I try to focus on everyday.
	 It's very important to take care of yourself and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
	 Ever since I was able to play sports I have taking advantage of doing so.
	 I've participated in gymnastics, i've played soccer, field-hockey, softball, and tennis.

 <br> Before coming to college I thought it would be smart to specifically focus on my studies; therefore 
	 I didn't commit to a sports team at Umaine. Instead, I have been focusing on yoga and other workout
	 regimens.  </br>
</h3>


<p> Why is fitness important? 
	A person who is fit is capable of living life to its fullest extent. 
	Physical and mental fitness play very important roles in your lives and people who are both, 
	physically and mentally fit are less prone to medical conditions as well.</p>
